## Unary Computing
[_**Unary computing**_](https://unarycomputing.github.io/) is a type of computing paradigm based on serial bits in streams, rather than parallel bits in conventional binary computing. 
The unary computing kernels are much simpler than conventional binary counterparts, but spend more cycles for a single operation. 

In general, a single unary computing kernel may not outperform the binary counterpart in terms of energy efficiency. However, at the system level, there are two advantages in unary computing over binary computing with respect to the system input.
1. If the system input is analog from sensors, unary computing eliminates the process of converting the analog signals to binary format and storing it, reducing the energy consumption [1, 2].
2. If the system input is already binary, due to the higher computing density resulting from simple logic, unary computing can achieve even higher energy efficiency than binary computing when the computational intensity reaches a certain threshold [3].

## UnarySim
This _**UnarySim**_ is a PyTorch-based cycle-accurate simulator for large scale unary computing, compatible to both CPU and GPU with high efficiency.

The paper related to this simulator, ["uGEMM: Unary Computing Architecture for GEMM Applications"](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9139000), is accepted to International Symposium on Computer Architecture (ISCA) 2020, and further awarded [IEEE Micro Top Pick](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9376243) from 2020 Computer Architecture Conferences.

The components included in UnarySim belong to three categories, including 
1. **Stream Manipulation**
2. **Computing Kernel**
3. **Performance Metric**

Among those, components in **Stream Manipulation** and **Computing Kernel** can physically exist in real hardware, while those in **Performance Metric** are virtually for performance analysis.

### Prerequisite
1. PyTorch (Version >= 1.10)
2. Python (Version >= 3.6)
3. [pylfsr](https://github.com/Nikeshbajaj/Linear_Feedback_Shift_Register)
4. numpy
5. [torchinfo](https://github.com/TylerYep/torchinfo)
6. matplotlib

Environment configuration before simulation: ```export PYTHONPATH=<UnarySim-Parent-Dir-Absolute-Path>/```

### Data Representation
UnarySim has five categories of data, with each having default data type as _**'torch.float'**_ in PyTorch.

1. **Source Data**: 
The input source data in unary computing need to be ranging from _0_ to _1_ in **unipolar** format (Uni), or from _-1_ to _1_ in **bipolar** format (Bi). 
The input source data (_source_) is scaled to a certain range (as in _unipolar/bipolar_ format) from the raw data (_raw_) with respect to its maximum.
An example scaling is _source = raw / max(raw)_.

2. **Random Number**: 
The random numbers (_rand_) are to be compared with the source data in order to generate the bitstreams. To notice, source data is in _unipolar/bipolar_ format, while random numbers are integers. 
To compare them, source data requires to scale up by the _bitwidth_ of random numbers. 
At each cycle, if _round(source * 2^bitwidth) > rand_, a bit of logic 1 in the stream will be generated; otherwise, a bit of logic 0 will be generated.

3. **Stream**: 
At each cycle, the bitstreams physically flow through cascaded logic kernels, and they count for most of the memory space during simulation. 
The bitstream can leverage either rate coding (RC) or temporal coding (TC).

4. **Buffer**: 
Inside each logic kernel, there may exist buffers, like counters or shift registers, to compute future data by monitoring the past bitstreams. 

5. **Metric Variable**: 
Those are variables to compute specially designed performance metrics.

### Directory Hierarchy
This directory contains multiple subdirectories, including _'stream'_, _'kernel'_, _'metric'_, _'test'_, _'app'_, _'hw'_,  covering three components mentioned above.

#### _'stream'_ subdirectory
This directory contains the components for **Stream Manipulation**, which manipulate the bitstreams for high performance and accuracy.
